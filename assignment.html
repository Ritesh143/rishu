				<h5>The community offers the following housing options</h5>
				<p>Studios- 315 sq. ft. ("A" Floorplan) - This is the most popular housing option among our student residents. It offers an open living area and has no designated bedroom. Only one student can occupy a studio.</p>
			    <p>Apartments - Just like a traditional apartment, these spacious units offer bedroom, dining room, and living room areas, and are available in the following styles:
				        One-bedroom / One bath, 536 sq. ft. ("B" Floorplan) - This plan can be occupied by a single student, or a student and two additional family members.
				        Two-bedroom / Two bath, 793 sq. ft. ("D" Floorplan) - This plan can be occupied by two single students ( one in each bedroom) or a student and three additional family members.</p>
				    <p>Suites - While offering bedroom and dining room areas, a suite is still smaller than an apartment because there is no living room area. For on-campus living, suites are the most inexpensive housing option available, and are offered in the following styles:
				        Two-bedroom / One bath, 536 sq. ft. ("C" Floorplan) - This option can be occupied by two students (one per bedroom).
				        Three-bedrooms / Two bath, 793 sq. ft. ("E" Floorplan) - This option can be occupied by three students (one per bedroom). One student will have a private bathroom while the other two students will share a bathroom.</p>
